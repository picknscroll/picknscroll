<h4 id="part-i-introduction-to-data-structures">Part I: Introduction to Data Structures</h4>

<p>[TODO: expand on common components (reading, manipulating, visualizing) and tedious details (data encoding/decoding, mathematical operations on columns of data)]</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<hr />

<!-- TODO: Touch on how we will be exploring the Data Structures with NBA data -->

<p>In recent years, the Pandas library has become the de-facto standard for analyzing data in Python. It has simplified data analysis by integrating its common components into a single package while abstracting away many tedious details. The end result is a win for analysts, who are free to achieve their objectives quicker and with more ease.</p>

<p>A typical data analysis using Pandas might involve the following three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data is first read from a csv file into a <strong>DataFrame</strong>, the library‚Äôs core data structure. (It is also easy to read data from other formats such as json, databases, even URLs with html tables).</li>
  <li>Once loaded,  data is manipulated in a variety of ways using the DataFrame‚Äôs interface.</li>
  <li>Insights are visualized using the DataFrame‚Äôs convenient plot method.</li>
</ol>

<div class="centerImgContainer">
  <img class="center" src="/assets/pandas.svg" />
</div>

<p>This post will introduce the library‚Äôs two core data structures: the Series and the DataFrame. In doing so, I will first explain the library‚Äôs approach to working with data, and second, familiarize the reader with the library‚Äôs key terms.</p>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: When writing to teach, my goal is to always explain the topic at hand as accessibly as possible. So as you will see, this post is by no means a comprehensive guide, but rather, a primer on the fundamentals. A more complete grasp of the library requires experimentation and reading the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/">documentation</a>.
<br /><br />
Most of all, I hope this post reduces the friction of starting for beginners, so that they can get to the fun part faster.
</div>

<p>Let‚Äôs get to it!</p>

<h4 id="the-series">The Series</h4>

<!-- TODO: set up shots_data.csv -->

<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python"> pd.Series(self, data=None, index=None, ...)</code></pre>
<hr />

<p>To begin learning about the Series data structure, we will play around with some data about assists. The following code snippet reads a csv containing data about the league‚Äôs top 10 passers, and loads it into a Series object for us to examine.</p>

<div class="section">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: import pandas as pd

        # Don't worry too much about what the parameters to the call mean
In [2]: assists = pd.read_csv('http://bit.ly/assist_series_csv', index_col=0, squeeze=True)

In [3]: type(assists)
Out[3]: pandas.core.series.Series

In [4]: assists
Out[4]:
PLAYER
Russell Westbrook    10.3
LeBron James          9.1
James Harden          8.8
Rajon Rondo           8.2
Ben Simmons           8.2
...                   ...
Name: AST, dtype: float64
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see, our series has two components: a list of player names and a list of values, which are the player‚Äôs assists per game for the 2017-18 regular season. In Pandas terminology, the player names are known as the <strong>index</strong> of our Series. One of the purposes of this index is to ‚Äúname‚Äù data elements - these ‚Äúnames‚Äù are referred to as <strong>labels</strong>.</p>

<p>Visually, our Series looks something like this:</p>

<div class="centerImgContainer">
  <img class="center" height="220px" src="/assets/series.svg" />
</div>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: Both the data and the index can be of any type (i.e. integers, strings, custom objects), with the one cavaet that all elements of the index must be hashable.
</div>

<p>The index is an explicit Pandas object, and is referenced through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.index</code> property:</p>

<div class="section">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: assists.index
Out[1]:
Index([u'Russell Westbrook', u'LeBron James', u'James Harden', u'Rajon Rondo',
       u'Ben Simmons', u'Chris Paul', u'Draymond Green', u'Jeff Teague',
       u'Kyle Lowry', u'Spencer Dinwiddie'],
      dtype='object', name=u'PLAYER')

In [2]: type(assists.index)
Out[2]: pandas.core.index.Index
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: If no index is provided when the Series is created, an index of integers raging from <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">len(data) - 1</code> is provided as a default.
</div>

<p>Index labels give the Series a ‚Äúdictionary-like‚Äù interface for selecting associated data values: 
<!-- [TODO]: make the code section underneath interactive, showing how different index labals can be selected. --></p>

<div class="section">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: assists['Russell Westbrook']

In [2]: assists['LeBron James']
Out[2]: 9.1

In [3]: assists['Carmelo Anthony']
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: üòÇüòÇ
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Aside from providing a convenient way to access data within the confines of a single Series object, the Index has another purpose, which becomes apparent when working with multiple Series.</p>

<p>Operations across Series objects are said to <strong>align</strong> on their indexes. This means that when two Series are, for example, divided together, pandas first consults their respective indexes to determine which elements to divide - matching elements when possible[1]. We can use this property to easily calculate the assist-to-turnover ratio for our top 10 passers, by dividing our <code class="highlighter-rouge">assists</code> series by another series containing turnover data for the same players.</p>

<div class="note">
<strong>From the docs</strong>: The result of an operation between unaligned Series will have the union of the indexes involved. If a label is not found in one Series or the other, the result will be marked as missing <code class="highlighter-rouge">NaN</code>.
</div>

<div class="section">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: tov = pd.read_csv('http://bit.ly/tov_series_csv', index_col=0, squeeze=True)

<p>Visually, alignment looks something like this:</p>

<div class="centerImgContainer">
  <img class="center" height="230px" src="/assets/alignmentv1.svg" />
</div>

<p>We can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sort_values</code> method to see which one of our top 10 passers had the best assist-to-turnover ratio:</p>

<div class="section">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: ast_to_tov.sort_values(ascending=False)

Jeff Teague          2.800000
...
dtype: float64
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As an aside, my friends and I watched Spencer Dinwiddie play for Taft High School during a tournament at our high school, when his most remarkable aspect was how closely his name resembled ‚ÄúDimwittie‚Äù. I never would have guessed he would one day be in the NBA, much less atop such an esteemed list.</p>

<p>This is the end of our introduction to the Series data structure, which was intended to illustrate one key concept: that of ‚Äúlabled and aligned‚Äù data. Next, we‚Äôll move onto the DataFrame, which represents this same concept, but in two-dimensions. But first, let‚Äôs do a quick recap of everything we‚Äôve learned, with an emphasis on the terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Series data structure is a one-dimensional array of data values, where each element has an accompanying <strong>label</strong>.</li>
  <li>Collectively, these labels are known as the <strong>Index</strong> of a Series.</li>
  <li>The Index faciliates selection of data within a single Series, making the Series ‚Äúdictionary-like‚Äù.</li>
  <li>The Index dictates how data elements relate to each other across multiple Series objects, a property known as <strong>alignment</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-dataframe">The DataFrame</h4>
<hr />

<h5 id="definition">Definition</h5>
<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python"> DataFrame(self, data=None, index=None, columns=None...)</code></pre>

<p>Our discussion of the Series data structure left us with three dangling series objects, one for assists, turnovers, and assist-to-turnover ratios. Clearly, there should exist a way to merge everything together into a single structure. Enter the <strong>DataFrame</strong>, which can be thought of as a concatenation of multiple series objects.</p>

<p>Concatenating multiple series together into a DataFrame is an aligned operation. And since all three of our series objects have equivalent indexes (the names of our top passers), grouping them together into a DataFrame is a tidy operation:</p>

<div class="section">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: df = pd.concat([assists, tov, ast_to_tov], axis='columns', keys=['assists', 'tov', 'ast_to_tov'])

In [2]: df
Out[2]:
                   assists  tov  ast_to_tov
Russell Westbrook     10.3  4.8    2.145833
LeBron James           9.1  4.2    2.166667
James Harden           8.8  4.4    2.000000
Rajon Rondo            8.2  2.3    3.565217
Ben Simmons            8.2  3.4    2.411765
...
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: DataFrames are typically created directly from a data source, such as a csv or a database table. The purpose of this toy example is to construct a DataFrame using what we already know.
</div>

<p>As mentioned before, a DataFrame is the two-dimensional representation of ‚Äúlabled and aligned‚Äù data. In the presence of this added dimension, our first order of business will be to establish how a DataFrame labels our data.</p>

<p>The index of a DataFrame labels an entire row of data, instead of a single data element as it does in a Series. In addition, a DataFrame labels each column of data, just like columns in a relational database are named. Column labels are also stored in an index object, and can be referenced through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">columns</code> property of the dataframe:</p>

<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: df.columns
Out[1]: Index([u'assists', u'tov', u'ast_to_tov'], dtype='object')

In [2]: df.index
Out[2]:
Index([u'Russell Westbrook', u'LeBron James', u'James Harden', u'Rajon Rondo',
       u'Ben Simmons', u'Chris Paul', u'Draymond Green', u'Jeff Teague',
       u'Kyle Lowry', u'Spencer Dinwiddie'],
      dtype='object')
</code></pre>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: Even though both row and colum labels are stored in an Index object, the DataFrame's index always refers to the one which labels its rows.
</div>

<p>The term <strong>axis</strong> is commonly used within pandas to specify the ‚Äúdirection‚Äù of an operation. For example, in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">concat</code> operation above, specifying <code class="highlighter-rouge">axis="index"</code> would have appeneded our three series objects ‚Äúrow-wise‚Äù - resulting in a single series with 30 data elements. The numbers 0 and 1 are often used as shorthand for ‚Äúindex‚Äù and ‚Äúcolumns‚Äù, respectively.</p>

<div class="centerImgContainer">
  <img class="center" height="250px" src="/assets/axis.svg" />
</div>

<p>The fact that both rows and columns are labeled gives a DataFrame a nice property. Each row in a DataFrame is a Series, and the index of this Series consists of the DataFrame‚Äôs column labels. Each column in a DataFrame is also a Series, and the index of this Series is the same as the original DataFrame‚Äôs index.</p>

<!-- <TODO: diagram here about selecting rows and columns yielding Series></TODO> -->

<p>A DataFrame also provides ‚Äúdictionary-like‚Äù functionality for selecting data by key. These keys must be column labels - trying to select data by index labels results in an error (selecting data in Pandas will be the subject of a future post):</p>

<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: df['assists']
Out[1]:
Russell Westbrook    10.3
LeBron James          9.1
James Harden          8.8
Rajon Rondo           8.2
Ben Simmons           8.2
...
Name: assists, dtype: float64

In [2]: df['Russell Westbrook']
Out[2]:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: 'Russell Westbrook'
</code></pre>

<!-- TODO: polish this section about extending a DataFrame -->
<p>Mathematical operations between DataFrames are aligned on both the index and column axes. But more importantly, alignment determines how a DataFrame can be extended to accomodate more data.</p>

<p>Appending a Series (or another DataFrame) is the most straight-forward way to extend a DataFrame. When adding more columns to a DataFrame, incoming data is aligned on index labels. This makes it very easy to add a new column that is, for example, the product of two existing columns. Since both existing columns have, by definition, the same index, their product can be easily aligned into DataFrame as well.</p>

<!-- TODO: show code for adding a new product column -->

<p>We now have enough background about Series and DataFrames to start doing the fun stuff - actually using Pandas to uncover insights about data, which we will do in future posts. But first, let‚Äôs quickly recap what we‚Äôve learned about a DataFrame:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>DataFrame</strong> is a two-dimensional array of data values, where <strong>each row and column</strong> has an accompanying label.</li>
  <li>While the column labels are also stored in an Index object, only the labels of the rows are known as the DataFrame‚Äôs index.</li>
  <li>A DataFrame has two <strong>axes</strong>: the 0/index (row) axis, and the 1/column axis.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve now built up enough of a mental model to leverage the power of the Pandas Library. The next section will cover:</p>
