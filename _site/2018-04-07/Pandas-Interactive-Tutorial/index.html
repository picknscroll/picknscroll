<p>[TODO: expand on common components (reading, manipulating, visualizing) and tedious details (data encoding/decoding, mathematical operations on columns of data)]</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<hr />

<p>In recent years, the Pandas library has become the de-facto standard for analyzing data in Python. Its popularity stems from how it has simplified data analysis by integrating its common components into a single package and abstracting away many of their tedious details. The end result is a win for analysts, who are free to achieve their objectives quicker and with more ease.</p>

<p>A typical data analysis using Pandas might involve the following three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data is first read from a csv file into a <strong>DataFrame</strong>, the library’s core data structure. (It is also easy to read data from other formats such as json, databases, even URLs with html tables).</li>
  <li>Once loaded, the data is wrangled in a variety of ways using the DataFrame’s querying interface.</li>
  <li>Finally, insights are visualized using the DataFrame’s convenient plotting method.</li>
</ol>

<div class="centerImgContainer">
  <img class="center" src="/assets/pandas.svg" />
</div>

<p>Pandas is a vast library, with many topics to cover, and unfortunately, a single post is not enough to span the entire territory. Instead, this post will begin by introducing the DataFrame, while defining the library’s core terms and concepts along the way. It will then build upon that knoweldge to explain how Pandas supports step 2 - namely, the various ways through which data residing in a DataFrame can be selected.</p>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: Pandas is rich with functionality, which makes it a joy to use. However, I found (and still find) a few parts of the library to be somewhat uninintuitive. My purpose for writing this post is thus two-fold. I hope to first explain the topic at hand as simply as I possibly can. But more importantly, I hope to equip the reader with enough knowledge and context to activate his or her own course of understanding, whether that be through Googling, reading the documentation, or best of all, playing around with the library.
</div>

<h2 id="the-building-blocks">The Building Blocks</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, the DataFrame is the primary data structure in Pandas. But before we get into what a DataFrame is, let’s begin with a simpler structure.</p>

<h4 id="the-series">The Series</h4>
<hr />

<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python"> pd.Series(self, data=None, index=None, ...)</code></pre>

<p>A Series has two components: an array of data values and an <strong>index</strong>, which is an accompanying array of the same length. Each element in the index effectively “names” the corresponding data element - these “names” are referred to as <strong>labels</strong> by the library.
[TODO]: touch on how elements of both data and the index can be of any type (index must be hashable)</p>

<div class="gridContainer">
  <img height="200px" src="/assets/list_to_series.svg" />
  <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

data = [8, 9, 7, 5]
index = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

series = pd.Series(data, index=index)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The index is an explicit Pandas object:</p>

<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: series.index
Out[1]: Index(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], dtype='object')

In [2]: type(series.index)
Out[2]: pandas.core.index.Index
</code></pre>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: If no index is provided when the Series is created, an index of integers raging from <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">len(data) - 1</code> is provided as a default.
</div>

<p>It can be helpful to think of a Series as an “augmented” list, as index labels provide dictionary-like functionality for selecting data elements by key:
[TODO]: make the code section underneath interactive, showing how different index labals can be selected.</p>

<div class="section">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">series['a'] = 8

series['b'] = 9

series['c'] = 7

series['d'] = 5
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the context of a single Series, the index provides a convenient way to access data. But indexes play another important role, which becomes apparent when working with multiple Series.</p>

<p>Operations across Series objects are said to <strong>align</strong> on their indexes. This means that when two Series are, for example, multiplied together, pandas first consults their respective indexes to determine which elements should be multiplied together.</p>

<p>[TODO: animate the svg, show the “step-wise” multiplying by index alignment]</p>

<div class="gridContainer">
  <img height="120px" src="/assets/alignmentv1.svg" />
  <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-python">s1 = pd.Series([2, 1], index=['A', 'B']

s2 = pd.Series([1, 2], index=['B', 'A'])

s3 = s1 * s2
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: If the indexes of the two series do not match, pandas will... [TODO: complete me]
</div>

<p>The concept of alignment by index extends beyond mathematical operations. Let’s say we want to “merge” two Series, that is, combine them into a single, beefier structure. What do you think will happen?</p>

<div class="centerImgContainer">
  <img class="center" height="150px" src="/assets/merge.svg" />
</div>

<p>And with that picture in mind, we are ready to move on the DataFrame. But first, let’s recap what we’ve learned, with an emphasis on the terms.</p>

<h5 id="recap">Recap</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>Series</strong> is an array of data values, where each element of data has an accompanying <strong>label</strong>.</li>
  <li>Collectively, these labels are known as the <strong>Index</strong> of a Series. Within a single Series object, the Index faciliates selection of data, making the Series “dictionary-like”</li>
  <li>The Index dictates how data elements relate to each other across multiple Series objects, a property known as <strong>alignment</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-dataframe">The DataFrame</h4>
<hr />

<h5 id="definition">Definition</h5>
<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python"> DataFrame(self, data=None, index=None, columns=None...)</code></pre>

<p>A Series packages data with an Index. The index both labels individual data elements and controls how operations on the data are aligned.
This idea of “labeled, aligned data” is a core concept within the Pandas library. Whereas a Series represents this idea in one dimension, a DataFrame represents it in two.</p>

<p>So back to our question of what happens when two Series objects are “merged” together into a single structure. The answer should come as no suprise: you get a DataFrame.</p>

<div class="centerImgContainer">
  <img class="center" height="175px" src="/assets/dataframe.svg" />
</div>

<p>Since there are now two dimensions to our structure, we need to expand on how a DataFrame labels our data.</p>

<p>Like a Series, the DataFrame has a single index - but instead of labelling individual data elements, it labels rows of data. This single index leads to a more formal definition of the DataFrame, which consists of multiple Series objects sharing a common Index.</p>

<p>A DataFrame also labels the columns of our data, just like columns in a relational database are named. Column labels are stored in their own Index object.</p>

<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: df.index
Out[1]: Index(['A', 'B'], dtype='object')

In [2]: df.columns
Out[2]: Index(['s1', 's2'], dtype='object')
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the DataFrame a nice property. Given a DataFrame <code class="highlighter-rouge">df</code> with Index <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> and columns <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>, each column in <code class="highlighter-rouge">df</code> is a Series with index <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>, while each row in <code class="highlighter-rouge">df</code> is a Series with index <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>.</p>

<p>A DataFrame provides “dictionary-like” functionality to a Series objects, where the keys are the column labels.</p>

<pre class="embedded highlight"><code class="language-python">In [1]: df['s1']
Out[1]:
A    2
B    1
Name: s1, dtype: int64

In [2]: df['s2']
Out[2]:
A    2 
B    1
Name: s2, dtype: int64
</code></pre>
