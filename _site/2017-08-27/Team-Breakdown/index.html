<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>

<p>The most interesting insight here is that stats relating to three pointers (3pt, 3pt%) and rebounding (drb, trb) have a definite negative slope. This implies that teams who benefit the most from winning that stat also win it the least, which intuitively means that the these stats are even <i>more</i> important to these teams.</p>

<p>The Pelicans with respect to defensive rebounding and the Timberwolves are of the most interesting to me. With DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis, it would seem to me that the Pelicans should be dominating the defensive glass. Yet, in the ‘16-17’ season, they only won the defensive rebounding battle 24 times, posting a +37.7% win percentage relative to their base percentage in those games. Digging a little deeper, # TODO: check what this breakdown looked like after the addition of DeMarcus Cousins.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves are fascinating because they posted a +39.5% win pct relative to base in games where they attempted/made? more three-pointers than their opponent, a clear indication how outside shooting benefits their team. By adding Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague, there’s no arguing that the Timberwolves upgraded their arsenal during the off-season. But even so, there still isn’t a ton of outside shooting on the floor. It will be interesting to see how the Timberwolves do with respect to the outside shot this season.</p>
