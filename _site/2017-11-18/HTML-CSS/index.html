  <h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>Define what a “layout” is? In general, just include a definitions header. What other words are there for “these technologies (when referencing HTML and CSS?”)</p>

<h5 id="audience-programmers-who-want-to-learn-more-about-html-and-css">Audience: programmers who want to learn more about HTML and CSS</h5>
<p>In this post, I will explain the basics of HTML and CSS, and how they work together to create the simple layout
that you see on this blog page. It is intended for programmers who have little or no experience with web development.</p>

<h4 id="my-own-experience">My Own Experience</h4>
<p>Before we start, I want to briefly touch on my own experience with HTML and CSS. This will not help you understand the technologies any better, so feel free to skip this section.</p>

<p>This site uses Jekyll and GitHub pages, which is a fantastic tool for publishing static content to the web. Because I knew next to nothing about HTML and CSS when creating the blog, I downloaded a layout from the internet, which allowed me to focus on the content. When I needed to make any changes to the layout, I would Google and blindly flip values here and there until I achieved the desired effect.</p>

<p>This worked fine - the blog looked the way I wanted to, and I didn’t have to spend more time than I wanted to learning HTML and CSS. It wasn’t until I started working at Periscope Data, where I have been doing front-end development, that I have come to understand the <strong>principles</strong> behind these technologies, which allows me to make changes to the layout in a <strong>predictable</strong> manner.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-html">What is HTML?</h3>
<p>[EDIT] -&gt; should I introduce browsers and rendering in this paragraph? Talk about what a markup language is? Elements?</p>

<p>Let’s first think about a typical blog post. A typical blog post will have distinct components: a title, headers, paragraphs of text, lists, tables, images, etc. As these components serve different purposes, they are displayed differently. Titles and headings are big and bold, items in lists are bulleted to imply some form of grouping. In other words, these components have visual <em>meanings</em>.</p>

<p>At its core, <strong>HTML is a way to assign visual meaning to plain text</strong>. <u>HTML Tags</u> are the mechanism through which this meaning is supplied, and they bracket the plain text, like this:</p>

<div class="subsection">&lt;h1&gt;h1 is a Heading Tag&lt;/h1&gt;</div>
<div class="note">
Note: &lt;h1&gt; is the opening tag, and &lt;/h1&gt; is the closing tag.
</div>

<p>The combination of HTML Tags and the plain text they enclose are known as <u>HTML elements</u>.</p>

<p>When browsers encounter HTML elements, they have a pre-defined notion of how those elements should be rendered. So by decorating plain text with HTML tags, I can tell the browser to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to create a bulleted list, and have this be the first item</li>
  <li>
    <h5 id="that-this-title">That This Title</h5>
    <p>should look different than the rest of the text in this item</p>
  </li>
  <li>that this item <a href="http://www.google.com">should link to Google!</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
Note: Hover over each element in the list to see the HTML tags used to provide the visual meaning.
</div>

<h3 id="what-is-css">What is CSS?</h3>

<p>Perhaps the best way to understand what CSS does is to see what this page looks like without any CSS.</p>

<p><button id="clickMe">Disable CSS</button></p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var cssEnabled = true;

  $("button#clickMe").on("click", function() {
  	var textToDisplay;
    if (cssEnabled) {
    	// TODO: check if this works in production
    	$('link[href="/assets/css/main.css"]').remove();
    }
    else {
    	$('head').append('<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/main.css" type="text/css" />');
    }
    cssEnabled = !cssEnabled;
    textToDisplay = cssEnabled ? 'Disable CSS' : 'Enable CSS'
    $(this).text(textToDisplay) // fuck you javascript.
  });
</script>
