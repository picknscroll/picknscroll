The first part of understanding the modern NBA involves understanding shot efficiency. Shot efficiency is really a function of two variables: shot distance and how much each shot is worth. 

Shot Type | Expected Pts. Per Shot
--------- | ----------------------
Restricted Area | 1.260
Right Corner 3 | 1.206
Left Corner 3 | 1.167
Above the Break 3 | 1.068
Mid-Range | 0.808
In The Paint (Non-RA) | 0.792
