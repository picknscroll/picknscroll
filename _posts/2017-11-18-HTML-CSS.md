#### Audience: anyone who wants to learn more about HTML and CSS

This post is intended for anyone who wants to learn more about the basics of HTML and CSS. It will  consist of 5 sections, which are as follows:

1. What is HTML?
2. What is CSS?
3. The Div Element and the Class Attribute
4. HTML Structure and Hierarchy
5. Putting it All Together: Towards a Simple Template

My goal is to a give a conceptual overview of HTML and CSS, including their purposes and how they are used together. To acheive this goal of conceptual understanding, I purposely omit specific "implementation details". For example, in our discussion of CSS, I do not mention the differences between inline styles and internal/external stylesheets.

At the end of the post, I will provide links that will help fill in the gaps of any omitted details.

Whoa, what is going on here?

Your eyes aren't playing a trick on you - the page looks like this for a reason. If you are still reading this, you presumably want to learn more about HTML and CSS, and I want to walk you through the basics of HTML and CSS by starting with a page that has none. As we explore the basics, we will gradually build the site back up into something more modern - and easier on the eyes. At the end, we will have created a simple blog template that will hopefully illustrate the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, and how they relate to each other.

## What is HTML?

Let's first think about a typical blog post. A typical blog post will have distinct components: a title, headers, paragraphs of text, lists, tables, images, etc. As these components serve different purposes, they are displayed differently. Titles and headings are big and bold to make them stand out, items in lists are bulleted to imply some form of grouping. In other words, these components have _visual meanings_.

This leads us to HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. A markup language (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)) is a "system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text". The parts of the document that are "syntatically distinguishable from the text" are known as <u>HTML tags</u>, and are important to browsers, as they **give the plain text visual meaning**. HTML tags bracket the plain text they annotate, like this:

```
<u> Underlined Text </u>
```

Note: &lt;u&gt; is the opening tag, and &lt;/u&gt; is the closing tag.

HTML tags, combined with the plain text they enclose, are known as <u>HTML elements</u>. Browsers have a pre-defined notion of how HTML tags should change the plain text they enclose. For example, when it sees "Underlined Text" surrounded by the ```<u>``` HTML tag from above, it will render it like this:

<u>Underlined Text</u>

By using HTML tags to create HTML elements, I can tell the browser to:

<ul>
	<li id="ul">create a bulleted list, and have this be the first item</li>
	<li id="link"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp">link this item to a list of HTML tags and their meanings</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
Note: Hover over each element in the list to see the HTML tags used to create the element
</div>


## What is CSS?

CSS is a language that lets users customize the "style" of webpages. Style can be an ambigious term, so to set the proper context , we will begin by noting that the above paragraphs have no styling (which is why they look like they come from the 1990s). This is another way of saying they were rendered by the browser's default interpretation of what HTML tags look like. We can change those defaults through a series of declarations called <u>CSS rules</u>.

Let's say I want to emphasize an important sentence by underlying it. Like we saw above, I would first give my sentence visual meaning by wrapping it in a ```<u>``` HTML tag. But say that's not enough - I now want to make my sentence stand out more by making it red. To do so, I need to write a CSS rule to tell the browser what exactly underlined text should look like.

<u style="color: red">This is an important sentence. Notice it.</u>

This short example illustrates the fundamental relationship between HTML and CSS.
**CSS rules apply to groups of HTML elements, and provide precise control over their visual representations.**

A CSS rule consists of [two parts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp), a <u>selector</u> and one or more <u>declarations</u>. Not coincidentally, these two parts map nicely to our fundamental relationship. Selectors are how we specify the group of HTML elements that will be styled. The declaration(s) are what precisely control the style, and apply to all the elements matched by the selector (we will refine this definition shortly)

We now know enough about CSS to add styling to our blog post. We'll use the most basic of CSS selectors, which simply mirror HTML tags. After such a "tag-based" CSS rule is established, whenever browsers encounter HTML elements annotated with such a tag, they will render it according to the delcared style.

An example will help make this concept clear. Click on the CSS rule below to center the text on all section headings on this page.

<pre id="centerh2" style="cursor: pointer">
h2 { text-align: center; }
</pre>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $("pre#centerh2").on("click", function() {
    $('head').append("<style>h2 { text-align: center; } </style>");
  });
</script>


## The Div Element and the Class Attribute

While we're making progress, our current capabilites are a bit limited. We can target specific groups of HTML elements by their tags, but what if we want to style <em>arbitrary</em> sections of our blog - say, all the text from here until the end of the page?

The <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;div&gt;</code> tag exists for this very reason. Unlike the HTML tags we have encountered so far, like headings or links, a <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;div&gt;</code> has no visual meaning. Instead, <b>the <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;div&gt;</code> allows for generic grouping of HTML elements, all of which can then become the targets of CSS selectors and custom styling declarations</b>.

Because of its grouping capabilities, the <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;div&gt;</code> is the most commonly used HTML tag. A simple "div-tag" CSS selector would therefore match almost every single element on the page. And while we gain a way to define groups of HTML elements, we also lose control. We combat this loss of precise control by adding <u>attributes</u> to our HTML tags. The most important attribute is the class attribute, and a HTML element with a class attribute specified looks like this:

<pre>
&lt;div class="myClass"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

Class attributes let us refine our selector queries. A special CSS selector exists for selecting all HTML elements belonging to a particular class - it involves pre-pending a "." in front of the class name.
To illustrate this, I've wrapped the rest of this post in a <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;div&gt;</code>, and I've given this <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;div&gt;</code> a class attribute called <code style="display: inline-block">addStyle</code>. Click on the CSS rules below to apply styling to the rest of this post from here on out - it will make the rest of the blog much more readable, I promise.

<pre id="addStyle" style="cursor: pointer">
.addStyle {
    width: 80%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    line-height: 1.6em;
    font-size: 20px;
    font-family: Georgia;
}
</pre>

<div class="addStyle">

<h2>Structure of HTML</h2>

Now that we know the &lt;div&gt; allows us to group HTML elements together for styling, we will precisely define how these groupings are achieved.

<br><br>

The HTML elements that make up this page are arranged in a tree. At the root of this tree is the <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;body&gt;</code> element, and all other elements are children of this element. Any HTML element can be either the child or parent of other HTML elements. To create a parent-child relationship between elements, we "nest" the child between the opening and closing tags of its parent, like this:

<pre>
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt; I am h1, the child of div. &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>


The parent-children relationship between elements is very important. We can now refine our defintion of CSS selectors from above: by default, <b>CSS rules apply to not only the exact elements matched by their selectors, but to all of their children elements as well</b>. In fact, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets - cascading is a reference to how styles cascade down from parent elements to children elements.
<br><br>


<h3> Putting These Concepts Together: A Simple Template </h3>
Now that we have a general understanding of how HTML and CSS work together, let's walk through a simple example to see how the concepts are used to create the basic template for this page.
To keep things simple, we will only focus on one aspect of our template — the centering of the text and the margins between the text and the window. 
<br><br>
We can take advantage of the fact that HTML elements automatically inherit the styling of the parents to achieve this effect. We first create a top-level <code style="display: inline-block">&lt;div&gt;</code> which will be the root element of our page; all of our blog’s content will be children of this root element. 
<br><br>
It is important to note that our root element does not have content associated with it. Its sole purpose is to group the elements that comprise of the blog together as one unit. For this reason, it is common to refer to these types of root elements as “container” or “wrapper” elements, and for these terms to show up as class attributes of the element as well.
<br>
<pre>
&lt;div class="content-container"&gt;
  BLOG CONTENT HERE
&lt;div&gt;
</pre>
Creating this container element gives us an easy target for the styling that we want to apply to our blog. We first set the width of our parent div to be a fixed percentage of the screen’s current width — in our case, it is set to 80%. Next, we set the left and right margins of our element to auto, which tells the browser to automatically center our content within the width we specified. We also set the font size and type, and how much space is in between each line (line-height).
<br>

<pre id="contentContainer" style="cursor: pointer">
.content-container {
    width: 80%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    line-height: 1.6em;
    font-size: 20px;
    font-family: Georgia;
}
</pre>

Since our content-container &lt;div&gt; is the the root of our HTML document, the rest of our content now inherits this styling by default. We're free to focus on the content of our post.


<h3> Recap </h3>
This is a basic example, but it is enough to illustrate the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. To recap:

<ul>
<li>HTML is a way to provide visual meaning to plain text. This meaning is supplied through HTML tags, which are interpreted in a certain way by the browser. Plaintext, combined with tags, are called HTML elements.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">List of HTML tags</a></li>
  </ul>
  <br>

<li>CSS is a way to provide custom styling to a webpage. Custom styles apply to groups of HTML elements, and are specified through CSS rules, which consist of a selector and a declaration.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">CSS Selectors</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax#CSS_declarations_blocks">CSS Declarations</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/edu/website-design/using-css/linking-your-css-to-your-website">External v Internal CSS</a></li>
  </ul>
  <br>

<li>The div tag lets us group HTML elements together, in arbitrary manners. Attributes let us refine our selector queries. When combined together, they give us precise control of how to style a page.</li>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp">HTML Attribtues</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25105736/what-is-the-order-of-precedence-for-css">CSS Order Preference</a></li>
 </ul>
 <br>

<li>HTML elements are arranged in a tree. A CSS rule that applies to a specific HTML element also applies to all children of that element as well.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.webreference.com/html/rendering/2.html">HTML Hierarchy</a></li>
   </ul>
   <br>

<li>
One easy way to take advantage of this hierachy is by setting generic style attributes in "container" &lt;div&gt; and letting these attributes percolate down to their children. In our example, we created a parent &lt;div&gt; with the class attribute "content-container". We specified some global style attributes of our blog - width and centering -, and let the rest of our blog inherit these styles by default.
</li>
</ul>


</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $("pre#addStyle").on("click", function() {
    $('head').append("<style> .addStyle { width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 20px; font-family: Georgia;  } </style>");
  });

</script>
